  Dr. Min Si is an Assistant Computer Scientist at
  Argonne National Laboratory working with the 
  <a href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/group/pmrs/" target="_blank">Programming Models and Runtime Systems</a> 
  group. Min's research interests include communication runtime in high-performance
  computing and parallel programming models.<br><br>

  Min was previously an Enrico Fermi Postdoctoral Scholar of Argonne National Laboratory.
  She received the Ph.D. degree in computer science from 
  <a href="http://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index_e.html" target="_blank">the University of Tokyo</a> 
  in 2016, under the supervision of <a href="http://olab.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~reiji/index.html" target="_blank">Prof. Reiji Suda</a> 
  and <a href="http://www-sys-aics.riken.jp/Members/ishikawa.html" target="_blank">Prof. Yutaka Ishikawa</a>. 
  Her doctoral dissertation focused on the optimization of high performance 
  message passing communication on massively parallel multi-/many-core 
  architectures. Previously, she received the M.S. degree in science 
  from the same university in 2012, supervised by <a href="http://www-sys-aics.riken.jp/Members/ishikawa.html" target="_blank">Prof. Yutaka Ishikawa</a>. 
  In her master thesis, she worked on the direct communication facility 
  for many-core based cluster systems.<br><br>

  Min is the recipient of the 2018 IEEE-CS Technical Consortium on High
  Performance Computing (TCHPC) Early Career Researchers Award for Excellence in
  High Performance Computing, and won the Karsten Schwan Best Paper Award at HPDC
  2018.
