<p>
  Dr. Min Si has recently joined Facebook as a Research Scientist. Min contributes to the
  aspect of high-performance-computing software/hardware co-design for AI at Facebook, specifically
  focusing on the interesting scale-out challenges for Facebook AI workloads.<br><br>
  
  Previously, Min was an Assistant Computer Scientist at
  Argonne National Laboratory working with the 
  <a href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/group/pmrs/" target="pmrs">Programming Models and Runtime Systems</a> 
  group. Her research at Argonne included communication runtime in high-performance
  computing and parallel programming models. Before that, Min was an Enrico Fermi
  Postdoctoral Scholar of Argonne National Laboratory.
  
  Min received the Ph.D. degree in computer science from 
  <a href="http://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index_e.html" target="utokyo">the University of Tokyo</a> in 2016.
  Her doctoral dissertation focused on the optimization of high performance 
  message passing communication on massively parallel multi-/many-core 
  architectures. Previously, she received the M.S. degree in science 
  from the same university in 2012. 
  In her master thesis, she worked on the low-level direct communication libraries 
  for many-core based system with InfiniBand interconnect.<br><br>

  Min is the recipient of the 2018 IEEE-CS Technical Consortium on High
  Performance Computing (TCHPC) Early Career Researchers Award for Excellence in
  High Performance Computing, and won the Karsten Schwan Best Paper Award at HPDC
  2018.
